# Content_Summarizer
The Content Summarizer is a Python-based app that generates concise summaries from .docx, .txt, and .pdf files using the Hugging Face BART model. It allows users to input text or upload files for summarization, with the option to rephrase summaries for varied outputs. The app also saves the original text and summaries to an SQLite database for easy retrieval. Designed for use with Google Colab, it supports file uploads directly within the environment. Simple to use, the app requires users to provide a Hugging Face API key for text processing. Built with Python and SQLite, itâ€™s an efficient tool for managing and simplifying lengthy content.
